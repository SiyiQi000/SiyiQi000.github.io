  Hi!
</p>

<p>
 I'm a postgraduate student in Nature Management at <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/">UCPH</a> now. 
 My undergraduate major is Landscape Architecture. After graduating from <a href="https://www.scau.edu.cn/">SCAU</a>, I worked as a landscape engineer at an institute in Shenzhen for two years. Then, I decided to make our urban ecological planning more rational. So I came to UCPH to pursue my scientific planning dream.
