  Hi!
</p>

<p>
 I'm a postgraduate student in Nature Management at [UCPH](https://www.ku.dk/english/) now. 
 My undergraduate major is Landscape Architecture. After graduating from [SCAU](https://www.scau.edu.cn/), I worked as a landscape engineer at an institute in Shenzhen for two years. Then, I decided to make our urban ecological planning more rational. So I came to UCPH to pursue my scientific planning dream.
> GIS help us more effectively improve human life while conserving our planet.
