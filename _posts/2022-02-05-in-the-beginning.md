I haven't studied Geography for 8 years. In 2014, I chose to learn Landscape Architecture instead of Geography. At that time, I wanted to combine my painting skill and my interests - Geography and Biology. From 2014 to 2021, I did mountains of trying in Landscape Architecture, including traditional crafts of Chinese gardens, vertical greening, urban greening design and planning, and so on. At last, I found that I am curious about the scientific theory behind urban ecological planning. That's why I came to [UCPH](https://www.ku.dk/english/) to learn Nature Management in 2021. I will put almost all effort into Geography and Ecology, especially the use of GIS in the future.
